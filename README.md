WeatherCompare App
This is an application geared toward travelers. It allows them to sign in and create trips where they
can store where they are going and the duration of their stay. Once departing and destination cities 
and dates of travel are inputted they will receive data back that tells them what the weather difference is 
from their destination city for each day of their trip. From there they can add things to do to their trip
by using the Fun Things to Do button that will let them run a Foursquare search.
